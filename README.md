Hi, this is my personal MVP implementation.<br>
Feel free to use it, study it or (even better) improve it!<br>
And I would be grateful if you pushed your changes into this repository
if youthink something could be done better or differently.

Thank you all.

## Clarification
My purpose was not the arrogance of presenting that repository as a library or a base-app. In reality it is only the desire of a student to apply, even in a very trivial way, something that I have studied, simply to fix it better in mind.

## Changelog
The changelog for this project can be found in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Thanks To
- [Matteo Brunello](https://github.com/BrunelloM) For showing me the MVP for the first time.

## Post Scriptum
I would like to clarify, to avoid misunderstandings, that I thought from scratch this implementation to the MVP.
If any of you know (or is intellectual owner) of an equal/similar implementation I would like to know.
